TODO:
Character:
  Run, Jump
  Ride vehicle
  Make all colliders their own Child Gameobj
    Hurtbox & Body for easier disable
    Give hurtbox collider 'Hurtbox' script
      Hurtbox can be universal, just needs to hold the gameobj's real parent

Vehicles:
  Create mech prototype
  Figure out how to get player 'IN' the damn thing
    Prob have to attach the player to a point on the mech
    AND
    disable the colliders for hitbox and body
